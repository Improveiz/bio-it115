  Hello my name is Tiger Trac. Born in Minnesota but moved to WA when I was very young. I am a 22-year-old currently a year up student. Iâ€™m also currently working at Costco located in Seattle. I am eager to learn html, css, and javascript. Along with learning excel and professionalism. I am a fast learner and would say I am able to work in a team. I also have some leadership skills from doing musical theatre.
